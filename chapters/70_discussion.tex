\chapter{Discussion}\label{chap:discussion}

Interpret the results.
What do they mean?
How do they relate to the research questions(s) or hypothesis(es) stated in the introduction?
The discussion can also be merged with either the ressults or the conclusion chapter, depending on the structure of the thesis.

If this chapter is separate from the ``Conclusion'' chapter, it should still draw minor conclusions about the results.
The ``Conclusion'' chapter is more to draw an overall conclusion over the thesis itself, how successful it was, if the main point could be answered and how it could be answered.
Drawing conclusions from individual experiments, e.g.\ that Experiment~X showed that Algorithm~A seems to work best on data that has property~P, should very much be done here.
These conclusions should then also be ``discussed'':
Is the result surprising?
Can it be theoretically justified?

This chapter (just like all other chapters except ``Experiments'') should not contain any new data gathered from experiments.
Everything that was measured should be in the ``Results'' chapter.
