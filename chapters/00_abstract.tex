TODO: Write the abstract here. Do not include things like \texttt{\char`\\abstract} or \texttt{\char`\\endabstract} commands, they would need to be included in main.tex.
This makes it possible to switch templates that may use different abstract environments, without having to change the abstract.tex file itself.

The abstract is supposed to be a short summary of the thesis, containing, among other, the following information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the current state of the art, or the problem that is addressed, or the question that is answered?
    \item What is the proposed method / solution?
    \item What experiments were performed?
    \item What are the main results (e.g. performance, accuracy, etc.)? The most important numbers should be included.
    \item What are implications of these results?
\end{itemize}

The abstract should be written in precise and objective language.
It should self-contained and understandable without deep knowledge of the field and without needing to read the thesis.
It should not contain any abbreviations, citations or references to figures.
